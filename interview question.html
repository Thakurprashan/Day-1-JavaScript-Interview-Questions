Q1.Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
Ans. In JavaScript, == and === are both used for comparison, key difference are:

# Loose Equality (==)
- Checks only the values of the operands, ignoring their data types.
- Performs type coercion if necessary, which means it tries to convert the operands to a common data type before making the comparison.

# Strict Equality (===)
- Checks both the values and the data types of the operands.
- Does not perform type coercion, so the operands must be of the same data type to be considered equal.

Examples are 

console.log(5 == "5"); // Output: true (type coercion occurs)
console.log(5 === "5"); // Output: false (data types are different)


Q2.What are the differences between var, let and const?

Ans.

# Var
- Scope: Function scope (the variable is accessible within the function it's declared in)
- Hoisting: Hoisted to the top of the function (can be accessed before declaration)
- Reassignment: Can be reassigned
- Redeclaration: Can be redeclared

# Let
- Scope: Block scope (the variable is accessible within the block it's declared in)
- Hoisting: Hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized until declaration (cannot be accessed before declaration)
- Reassignment: Can be reassigned
- Redeclaration: Cannot be redeclared in the same scope

# Const
- Scope: Block scope (the variable is accessible within the block it's declared in)
- Hoisting: Hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized until declaration (cannot be accessed before declaration)
- Reassignment: Cannot be reassigned
- Redeclaration: Cannot be redeclared in the same scope

Example are 

// Var
console.log(varVariable); // Output: undefined
var varVariable = 10;
console.log(varVariable); // Output: 10

// Let
console.log(letVariable); // Output: ReferenceError
let letVariable = 10;
console.log(letVariable); // Output: 10

// Const
console.log(constVariable); // Output: ReferenceError
const constVariable = 10;
console.log(constVariable); // Output: 10


Q3.What is execution context.
Ans. In JavaScript, an execution context is an environment in which the JavaScript code is executed. 
It's a abstract concept that refers to the scope, variables, and functions that are currently being executed.
In simple words, an execution context in JavaScript is like a "workspace" where the code is executed.

Q4.What is creation phase and execution phase.
Ans. 
1. Creation Phase (Memory Allocation Phase)
    Happens when a function or script is first run.
    The JavaScript engine allocates memory for variables and functions before executing the actual code.

2. Execution Phase (Code Execution Phase) 
    The JavaScript engine executes the code line by line after memory allocation.
    It assigns values to variables and executes function calls.

Q5.What is hoisting?
Ans. Hoisting is a JavaScript concept where variables and functions are moved to the top of their scope, 
regardless of where they are actually declared.

Here's a simple example:

console.log(x); // Output: undefined
var x = 10;

In this example, even though x is declared after it's logged to the console, 
it's still accessible because it's been "hoisted" to the top of its scope.


Q6.Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN
Ans.

Undefined
- A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
- Indicates that a variable has no value or is not initialized.
- Example: var x; console.log(x); // Output: undefined

Not Defined
- A variable that has not been declared.
- Indicates that a variable does not exist or is not recognized.
- Example: console.log(x); // Output: ReferenceError: x is not defined

NaN (Not a Number)
- A value that represents an invalid or unreliable numeric result.
- Often occurs when attempting to perform mathematical operations on non-numeric values.
- Example: console.log("hello" * 2); // Output: NaN

Q7.How many operators do we have in JS ? 
Ans. 

1. Arithmetic Operators (5)
    - + (addition)
    - - (subtraction)
    - * (multiplication)
    - / (division)
    - % (modulus)

2. Assignment Operators (6)
    - = (assignment)
    - += (addition assignment)
    - -= (subtraction assignment)
    - *= (multiplication assignment)
    - /= (division assignment)
    - %= (modulus assignment)

3. Comparison Operators (6)
    - == (equal)
    - != (not equal)
    - === (strict equal)
    - !== (strict not equal)
    - > (greater than)
    - < (less than)

4. Logical Operators (3)
    - && (logical and)
    - || (logical or)
    - ! (logical not)
    5. Bitwise Operators (6)
    - & (bitwise and)
    - | (bitwise or)
    - ^ (bitwise xor)
    - ~ (bitwise not)
    - << (left shift)
    - >> (right shift)

6. Unary Operators (3)
    - + (unary plus)
    - - (unary minus)
    - delete (delete operator)

7. Ternary Operator (1)
    - ?: (ternary operator)

Q8.Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in javascript
Ans. 

#Local Scope
Local scope refers to the variables and functions defined within a specific block of code, such as a function or a block statement. 
Variables defined in local scope are only accessible within that block of code.

#Block Scope
Block scope is a type of local scope that is specific to a block statement, such as an if statement or a loop. 
Variables defined in block scope are only accessible within that block statement.

#Functional Scope
Functional scope, also known as function scope, refers to the variables and functions defined within a function. 
Variables defined in functional scope are only accessible within that function.

#Scope Chain
The scope chain is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to search for variables and functions in multiple scopes. 
When a variable or function is referenced, JavaScript
